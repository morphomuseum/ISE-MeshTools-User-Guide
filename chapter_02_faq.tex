    \section{How should I cite ISE-MeshTools in scientific publications ?}
    You may  cite ISE-MeshTools with the following reference :\\
		Lebrun, R. ISE-MeshTools, a 3D interactive fossil reconstruction freeware. 
		12th Annual Meeting of EAVP, Torino, Italy; 06/2014.
    \section{Is ISE-MeshTools a geometric morphometrics software ?}
    No. However, you can digitize 3D landmarks on complex 3D surfaces using ISE-MeshTools, which you 
		can use in other software.
		\section{Can I produce/extract 3D meshes out of CT/MRI data using ISE-MeshTools ?}
		No. To extract 3D meshes CT/MRI data sets, you have to use another software. However, you can edit 
		3D Meshes in various ways using ISE-MeshTools.
		\section{Is there a CTRL-Z functionnality around ?}
		No, there is currently no way to cancel any action. So remember to regularly save your work (especially when tagging surfaces), otherwise precious hours of work can be lost in a second.
