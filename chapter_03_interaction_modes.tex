 \section{Selection modes}
 \subsection{Normal mode}
Press ``\includegraphics{images/pixmap/Normal_select_mode.png}" to activate this mode.\\
This is the default selection mode. Selected objects (meshes and landmarks) are drawn ``grey". Unselected ``normal" landmarks are red, while ``target" landmarks are yellow. Unselected meshes can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using a uniform colour (default modes)
\item According to tag values at each vertex (tag display mode active \includegraphics{images/pixmap/Show_Tag_Window.png})
\item	According to scalar values at each vertex (scalar display mode active \includegraphics{images/pixmap/show_color_scale.png} )
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Tag mode}
Press ``\includegraphics{images/pixmap/Tag_select_mode.png}"to activate this mode
This mode is useful when tagging surfaces (as you can only interact with selected objects). Unselected meshes are drawn ``grey".  Unselected ``normal" landmarks are red, while ``target" landmarks are yellow. Selected landmarks are grey, while selected meshes can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Using a uniform colour (default modes)
\item According to tag values at each vertex (tag display mode active \includegraphics{images/pixmap/Show_Tag_Window.png})
\item	According to scalar values at each vertex (scalar display mode active \includegraphics{images/pixmap/show_color_scale.png} )

\subsection{Camera mode}
  \includegraphics{images/pixmap/move.png}``Camera mode" is the default interaction mode, and is active on startup. When active, left and middle mouse button drags result in camera rotation/translation, respectively.
\subsection{Object mode}
   \includegraphics{images/pixmap/move_mode2.png}When active, left and middle mouse button drags result in object rotation/translation, respectively.
\subsection{Landmark mode}
  \includegraphics{images/pixmap/Landmarks2.png}When active, only landmarks can be selected/unselected via right mouse button drag/click. This mode is useful when editing/placing landmarks. Left and middle mouse button drags result in camera rotation/translation, respectively.

\section{Landmark setting modes}
Landmarks can be set on surfaces by pressing ``L" + left mouse click. 
Two series of conventional landmarks can be set with ISE-MeshTools: ``normal" and ``target" landmarks. Additionally a third landmark series (``flag" landmarks) can be used to label surface structures. 
\subsection{Normal landmark mode}	
Press ``\includegraphics{images/pixmap/Landmarks4.png}" to activate this mode (this mode is active by default)
\subsection{Target landmark mode}	

Press ``\includegraphics{images/pixmap/Landmarks6.png}"  to activate this mode
\subsection{Flag landmark mode}	

Press ``\includegraphics{images/pixmap/Flag01.png}" to activate this mode
