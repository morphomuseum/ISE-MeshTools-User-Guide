	\maketitle
   ISE-MeshTools is a software designed by Renaud Lebrun, from the university of Montpellier II. ISE-MeshTools is a 
system for the processing and editing of series of 3D triangular meshes. The system provides a set of tools for editing, 
positioning, deforming, labelling, measuring and rendering sets of 3D meshes. Features include:\\
•Retrodeformation for un-deforming fossils/deformed specimens\\
•Point and curve primitives for placing the exact type of landmark points you’re interested in\\
•Easy to use 3D interface for positioning and manipulating sets of surfaces and landmark primitives\\
•Mesh tagging, labelling and colouring (to allow for the creation of anatomy atlases)\\
• Mesh scalar computation and colouring (based upon curvature/thickness etc...)
