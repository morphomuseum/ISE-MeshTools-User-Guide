\section {Design concepts}
I wish to thank Christoph Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León, from whom I borrowed many of the design concepts implemented in FoRM-IT (Fossil Reconstruction and Morphometry Interactive Toolkit; \citep{Zollikofer1995,Zollikofer2005}).

\section {Code development}
 I wish to thanks Cécile Peladan, who has successfully implemented GPU acceleration and ICP registration functions, and Gérard Subsol, with whom I supervised Cécile during her Master Thesis project. Many thanks to Stefan Schlager and Jean Dumoncel for their helpful comments and their contribution to the cross-platform compatibility of the source code.  

\section{Specimens illustrated} 
I wish to thank the curators of different institutions for the access to most specimens illustrated

Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León from the Anthropological Institute and Museum of Zürich,
Jacques Cuisin from the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle de Paris, Peter Giere and Robert Asher from the
Museum für Naturkunde (Berlin), Suzane Jiquel from the ISEM, Nadine Mestre-Francès from the

the PEPS IdEx Bordeaux / CNRS 3 Dent'in for the access to the digital reconstruction of the specimen
SP07 of Sains-en-Gohelle, and Cédric Beauval and Archéosphère SARL (Bordeaux) for the access to
these remains.

\section{3D data acquisition facilities} 
I wish to thank the MRI Platform (Montpellier), Zollikofer and Marcia Ponce de León from the
Anthropological Institute and Museum (Zürich), Paul Tafforeau and the E.S.R.F. (Grenoble, France) for
the access to the scanning facilities in which the illustrated specimens were digitized.
